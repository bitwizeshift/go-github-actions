# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance and decision-making process for this
project.

## Decision Making

As this is a personal project, all decisions regarding the project direction,
feature implementation, and changes are made by the project owner. The
decision-making process is primarily driven by personal interests and goals.

### Process

1. **Idea Generation**: Ideas for new features or changes are generated based
   on personal interests, needs, and goals. These can come from a variety of
   sources, including personal experiences, user feedback, or inspiration from
   other projects.

2. **Evaluation**: Each idea is evaluated based on its potential impact on the
   project, the amount of work required to implement it, and its alignment with
   the project's goals and interests.

3. **Implementation**: If an idea is deemed worthwhile, it is then implemented.
   This may involve writing new code, modifying existing code, or removing
   outdated code.

4. **Review**: After implementation, the changes are reviewed. This involves
   testing the changes to ensure they work as expected and reviewing the code to
   ensure it meets the project's quality standards.

5. **Deployment**: Once the changes have passed the review process, they are
   deployed to the project.

## Feedback and Contributions

While this is a personal project, feedback and contributions from others are
always welcome! However, the final decision on whether to incorporate any
feedback or contributions into the project lies with the project owner.

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be updated from time to time based on the evolving
needs and interests of the project. Any changes to the governance structure will
be made by the project owner.
