# Contribution Guidelines

👋🏻 First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project!

## Easy Guide

### Do you have a suggestion for a new feature?

> [!INFO]
>
> Before make suggestions, please check the list of enhancements suggestions
> in this repository's [Discussion] to see if it has already been suggested.
> If it has, you can add your comments to the existing topic instead of
> creating a new one.

* Open a [Discussion] topic for your suggestion.
* Provide as much detail as you can for your idea, and why you think it would be
  an improvement.
* If the idea is accepted, it will be tracked in [GitHub Issues] and prioritized
  accordingly.
* If you are interested in implementing the feature, follow the below steps.

### Did you find a bug?

> [!INFO]
>
> Before opening a bug, make sure it hasn't already been reported by searching
> [GitHub Issues] and project [Discussion]s.

* Open a new GitHub Issue, or -- if you are unsure -- a [Discussion] to discuss
  the issue. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant
  information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case
  demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue.

  duplicated efforts.
* Make sure to include **unit tests** and updating **documentation** where
  applicable.
* Open a [Pull Request] with your change.
